        Dancing is my passion. I have been learning Kathak since the age of 2. It feels really good when I do kathak in front of the audience, on the stage. Whenever I get free time, I spend my time learning new kathak steps, choreographing new songs, and watching kathak videos. Kathak should be performed with grace, expressions and smooth steps.
          Kathak was done in front of mughal kings and emperors for their entertainment. Many kathak dances show the plays of Radha-Krishn and Ram - Sita. During mono-act performances, they take a turn and change the character.
